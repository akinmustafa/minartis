## Minartis
Minartis is my personal open-source first person sandbox game project featuring in-game coding and modding support.

I will periodically release new versions here.

- Project is under active development. It might not fit the description you are reading right now. It will take a while to implement things since I'm the only one working on it. If you have suggestions, found a bug/error/mistake etc. hit me up on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/501804360079245312).

### Notes
- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) version is 2021.3.25f1 Personal.
- Project uses the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://unity.com/srp/universal-render-pipeline) for rendering.
- Check out [MiniScript](https://github.com/JoeStrout/miniscript) for further information about modding support.
